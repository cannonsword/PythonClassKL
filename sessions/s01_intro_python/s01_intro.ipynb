    "This is an introductory course in programming in Python that was developed for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) students. The course focuses on using Python for data analysis and visualization. This course was developed by the Issaquah Robotics Society (IRS), FRC 1318, to prepare students to maintain, operate, and extend the IRS's FRC scouting system."

    "* Create and run Python functions.\n",
    "* Organize Python code into classes.\n",
    "* Get data from external sources using HTTP and SQL.\n",
    "* Manipulate and analyze tabular data using Pandas, a powerful Python package for data analysis.\n",
    "* Evaluate data using descriptive statistics.\n",
    "* Create data visualizations using Bokeh, a Python package for creating charts and graphs.\n",
    "* Use Python for other scientific or engineering projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessary materials\n",
    "* Laptop, preferably Windows 10 because thatâ€™s what the instructor uses, but any operating system should work.\n",
    "* No books needed - all necessary reference materials are online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructional Techniques\n",
    "The course author believes that the ability to use official documentation is essential for a good analyst or programmer.\n",
    "* Instead of replicating resources that are already available, students will be directed to review official documentation when appropriate.\n",
    "* This course is more of a roadmap than a complete tutorial.\n",
