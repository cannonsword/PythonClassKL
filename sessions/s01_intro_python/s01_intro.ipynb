    "* Create and run Python functions.\n",
    "* Organize Python code into classes.\n",
    "* Get data from external sources using HTTP and SQL.\n",
    "* Manipulate and analyze tabular data using Pandas, a powerful Python package for data analysis.\n",
    "* Evaluate data using descriptive statistics.\n",
    "* Create data visualizations using Bokeh, a Python package for creating charts and graphs.\n",
    "* Use Python for other scientific or engineering projects.\n",

    "### Necessary materials\n",
    "* Laptop, preferably Windows 10 because thatâ€™s what the mentor uses, but any operating system should work.\n",
    "* No books needed - all necessary reference materials are online.\n",
