    "It is at least as important to understand *why code works* as it is important to understand why it doesn't work. Spend some time thinking about the examples and exercises and why they work. Experiment by making modifications to the code. When it comes to code, every character, every symbol, and even many of the blank spaces are there for a reason.\n",

    "Some things can be best explained by flipping the logic. What if you didn't care if you ever used Python to do anything useful? Here are a few ways to ensure that this course is a waste of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't establish a routine for learning Python. Make sure at least two weeks elapse between sessions, so you can forget all of the old material before attempting anything new.\n",
    "2. Comprehension is overrated - go ahead and speed read the reading assignments.\n",
    "3. If the code works, don't ask yourself why it worked this time and didn't work last time. Just move on.\n",
    "4. Use copy and paste as much as you can. Don't practice the details of syntax by typing code by hand.\n",
    "5. Immediately look up the answer to an exercise if the solution is not obvious.\n",
    "6. Avoid reading official documentation like the plague.\n",
    "7. Don't ever look at anyone else's code to see how they approached a problem.\n",
    "8. Don't talk about concepts or exercises with other students or mentors. Assume you are on your own if you get stuck.\n",

    "## III. Why do We Need Control Statements? \n",
    "Completing numerical calculations and extracting characters from text strings is all well and good. But programs that just execute the same sequence of statements every time are a bit boring. For a program to do anythng interesting, it needs to make decisions and execute different statements based on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control statements allow a program to respond differently in different situations. Fundamentally, a control statement determines whether other statements are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic control statement is the `if` statement. Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if num_cheetos_left == 0:\n",
    "    print('We need to buy more Cheetos!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common control statement is the `while` statement, which continues to execute a block of statements until a condition is true.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "while power_cells < 5:\n",
    "    pickup_power_cell():\n",
    "```           \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great things about Python is that it is easy to read. Even though you are new to Python, you probably get the gist of both of these control statements."
