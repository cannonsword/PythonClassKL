    "Completing numerical calculations and extracting characters from text strings is all well and good. But programs that just execute the same sequence of statements every time are a bit boring. For a program to do anythng interesting, it needs to make decisions and execute different statements based on the situation.\n",

    "Control statements allow a program to respond differently in different situations. Fundamentally, a control statement determines whether other statements are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic control statement is the `if` statement. Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if num_cheetos_left == 0:\n",
    "    print('We need to buy more Cheetos!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common control statement is the `while` statement, which continues to execute a block of statements until a condition is true.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "while power_cells < 5:\n",
    "    pickup_power_cell():\n",
    "```           \n",

Stop Python by hitting the black square on the toolbar (next to *Run*). Or you can select *Kernal -> Interrupt* from the menu. Or you can press ESC and then press *I* twice.\n",

Every time Python finishes an iteration of the loop, goes back to the beginning, and checks `count >= 0`, count will always be greater than zero. I suppose that sometime over the next several billion years, it's possible that some gamma rays could hit your computer and flip the bits to a value less than zero, but I suspect you will have stopped paying your electricity bill by then, so the point is moot.\n",
