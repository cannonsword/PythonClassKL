    "Completing numerical calculations and extracting characters from text strings is all well and good. But programs that just execute the same sequence of statements every time are a bit boring. For a program to do anythng interesting, it needs to make decisions and execute different statements based on the situation. For this, we need control statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control statements are a special type of statement that determine which other statements will be executed, how many times they will be executed, and in what order. In a sense, they control the flow of programming statements within the computer program. They allow a program to respond differently in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic control statement is the `if` statement. Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if num_cheetos_left == 0:\n",
    "    print('We need to buy more Cheetos!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common control statement is the `while` statement, which continues to execute a block of statements until a condition is true.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "while power_cells < 5:\n",
    "    pickup_power_cell():\n",
    "```           \n",

    "6. The *count* variable is now equal to 9, which is still greater than 0. Python executes the two statements within the loop, on lines 4 and 5, again.\n",

    "  * You have just placed Python in an infinite loop. You can tell that it's still running because of the asterisk to the left of the code cell. Stop Python by hitting the black square on the toolbar (next to *Run*). Or you can select *Kernal -> Interrupt* from the menu. Or you can press ESC and then press *I* twice.\n",
    "  * If you remove the decrement statement (line 5), the value in count never gets smaller. Every time Python finishes an iteration of the loop, goes back to the beginning, and checks `count >= 0`, count will always be greater than zero. I suppose that sometime over the next several billion years, it's possible that some gamma rays could hit your computer and flip the bits to a value less than zero, but I suspect you will have stopped paying your electricity bill by then, so the point is moot.\n",
