Python code is generally saved in a text file with a *.py* extension. Each Python file constitutes a unit of code called a *module*. In this session we will first cover an essential tool for working with modules, the programmer's text editor, and then we will cover modules themselves."

For now, just understand that the [`sys` module provides many useful functions and objects for interacting with your computer's operating system](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html). To use these objects and functions, we must first import the module, which is why we added `import sys` to the `misc.py` file.\n",

    "*Module* is a frequently-used term when it comes to Python. For now, you can consider a Python file and a Python module to be the same thing. For example, the `cubit.py` file you created for exercise III.C.1 creates a `cubit` module. Modules and Python files are not really the same thing, but we'll wait to discuss the distinction until after we've gone through a couple examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are important because they allow us to organize complex Python programs by splitting Python code into several files. Think about it -- if all of the code for our Python program were in some 100-page Python file, it would be difficult to find the code that we want to work on. It would also be difficult for multiple programmers to work on the program because they would all be trying to work in the same file simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Importing  a Module\n",
    "We already saw how we can import a module from the Python standard library with the `import` statement. Now we're going to see how we can import a module that we created and use a function from that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Python file called `mod_test.py`. Make sure you put `mod_test.py` in the same folder as `misc.py`, which you created back in section II.\n",
    "2. Add the following code to `mod_test.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import misc\n",

    "\n",
    "Look carefully at the code we just ran.\n",
    "  * We defined another function called `echo` that takes one argument. But unlike the `echo` function in the `misc.py` file, this other version of `echo` ignores the argument and prints the same message every time it is run.\n",
    "  * We called a function called `echo` twice. The first time we called it as `echo(...)` and the second time we called `misc.echo(...)`.\n",
    "  * We can tell from the output that when we called `echo(...)`, we ran the function defined in `mod_test.py`. When we called `misc.echo(...)`, we ran the function defined in `misc.py`.\n",
    "  \n",

    "### B. Modules are Objects\n",

    "import frc1318_data\n",
    "\n",
    "print(frc1318_data.team_name)\n",
    "print(frc1318_data.city)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(frc1318_data.get_current_roster())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to talk about the differences between Python files and modules. A Python file is just a text file on your hard drive that contains Python code. As far as your operating system is concerned, it's no different than any other text file. But do you notice how `frc1318_data` in the example above behaves like an object? Like other objects we've seen, it has attributes (`team_name` and `city`) and methods (`get_current_roster()`). It behaves like an object because *it is an object*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we ran the code `import misc`, Python found the file *misc.py*, ran all of the code in that file, and created an object of type *module* named `misc`. To see for yourself, add the line `print(type(misc))` to the end of *mod_test.py* and re-run the program. A Python module is an object that is created from a Python file and is stored in memory. Module objects can be used directly within Python programs. In summary, when we refer to Python files, we're referring to text files, usually with a `.py` suffix, that are stored on your hard drive. When we refer to modules, we are referring to a type of Python object that is created from a Python file and is stored in your computer's memory. Modules and Python files are similar in the sense that a Python module is usually created from a corresponding Python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Namespaces\n",
    "Also, did you notice how using modules allowed us to have two different functions both named `echo`? This is a very useful feature of modules. Suppose you and another student decide to write a Python program. If you were to store all of your Python code in one file, you would have to work out some system to prevent having duplicate names for variables or functions. But if you both keep your code in separate modules, then it doesn't matter if you use duplicate names. Every Python module has it's own *namespace*. A namespace is a set of names for various Python objects. One set of names (i.e., namespace) is defined within `misc.py` and another set is defined within `mod_test.py`. The concept of a `namespace` occurs in many programming languages."

    "2. When you come across one of these imported items in the code, like `team_name` or `city`, it's not obvious that they were imported.\n",
